title: A journey along the written word
---

In Haruki Murakami's [Sputnick sweetheart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Sweetheart), one of the main characters muses about her need to write things down in order to think clearly. I've decided to take a cue from her and personal experience. Over the next 30 days, I'll try to write as much as I can and publish here. 

I do maintain a tech blog, [Tech and Mortals](http://techandmortals.wordpress.com/), but I rarely publish content there nowadays. Before I jumped into the data and tech world, I'd aspired to be a writer, if only for a brief while. In addition to being an escape, this is also an attempt to get back to my writing ways and meld it with my life as a novice technologist. In this day and age of information overload, writing seems like a worthwile escape. Its yet to be seen if I'll gain any clarity at the end of this exercise but its a start.

My obsession for perfectionism coupled with near-perfect procrastination has contributed heavily towards slowdown of my writing. Hence, most of the content here will be a free-flow of thoughts. The posts can range from purely technical to philosophical but will always revolve around my experience in the tech world in some form. Although its primarily a personal endavour, I hope that some of you will find the content worthwhile nevertheless.
